## Bit Mnipulation
    1. Single Number III- Given an array of numbers A , in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. --- singlenumber3.go

    2. Reverse the bits of an 32 bit unsigned integer A. --- reversebit.go

    3.  Given two integers A and B, find a number X such that A xor X is minimum possible, and the number of set bits in X equals B. ---  smallestxor.go

    4. Write a function that takes an integer and returns the number of 1 bits it has. --- 4-countsetbits.go
