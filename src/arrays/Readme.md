## Arrays
    1. Given an integer array A of size N. Return 1 if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression, otherwise, return 0.  1-ArithmeticProgression.go
    2. Given a array A of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number. 2-LargestNumber.go
    3. Given an integer array A of size N. In one operation, you can remove any element from the array, and the cost of this operation is the sum of all elements in the array present before this operation. 3-ElementsRemoval.go
    4. Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(n/2) times. 4-MajorityElement.go
    5. You're given a read only array of n integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than n/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.
